Welcome to the Data Role Evaluation App!

This app allows you to evaluate candidates for different data roles based on their skills and experience.

Here the steps to follow:

## Coefficient setting

A unique coefficient is attributed for each topic (such as Python, SQL, ETL, Dataiku, etc).  
We suggest a default coefficient distribution (see below), but you can set and save your own configuration in the Coefficient Setting page.

Based on these coefficients, the interviewer will select a status for the candidate among Junior, Intermediate, Confirmed and Expert.  
The status will act as a multiplicator over the coefficients.
This step is processed in the _Evaluation_ page, and must be finalized by using the _Submit_ button at the bottom.

After the Evaluation step, the Results page will display some analysis, such as a spider graph showing a score for each data role for the candidate, or a summary dataframe.
